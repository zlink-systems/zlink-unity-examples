# ZLink Engine Lobby Unity sample

One `ZLinkClient` MonoBehaviour connects to the Engine Lobby server with the same game code in
native and WebGL players. It sends `JoinReq` and `ChatMsg` at startup, pumps the connector from `Update`,
and replaces the centered UI text when `ChatNotify` arrives.

## Unity version

The project is pinned to **Unity 6 LTS 6000.0.83f1**. The WebGL UPM manifest allows Unity 2021.3
or later, but the repository's real WebGL adapter verification project also uses 6000.0.83f1, so
the sample and its verification target one editor version.

## Install packages

`Packages/manifest.json` pins these packages:

- NuGetForUnity `v4.5.0`
- `com.zlink.stream-connector.webgl` at `framework-node/v0.25.0`
- Unity UI `2.0.0`

`Assets/packages.config` declares `Zlink.Stream.Connector` `0.25.0` for the Editor and native
desktop/mobile/console players. If the first open reports compile errors before that package is
present, choose **Ignore**, not Safe Mode, and run **NuGet → Restore Packages**.

Both connector assemblies define the same public types, so each build target must include exactly
one:

1. Select the restored `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.dll` in the Project window.
2. In the Plugin Inspector, disable **WebGL** compatibility and enable only the Editor and required
   native platforms.
3. If the native connector is consumed as source instead of a DLL, put
   `"excludePlatforms": ["WebGL"]` in its asmdef.
4. Do not change the WebGL UPM package asmdef; it already has
   `"includePlatforms": ["WebGL"]`.

## Run the scene

1. Build and start the server from `../Server`.

   ```bash
   ./run_sample.sh build
   ./run_sample.sh run
   cat .run/stream.port
   ```

2. Open `Assets/Scenes/EngineLobby.unity` in Unity.
3. Set the `ZLinkClient` GameObject's **Endpoint** to `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` using the printed
   port.
4. Enter Play mode. The text changes from `joined as ...` to
   `unity-player: hello from Unity`.
5. After leaving Play mode, run `./run_sample.sh stop` in the server directory.

The `connect`, `pump`, `handler`, and `lifecycle` snippet markers in `ZLinkClient.cs` are the source
boundaries read by the engine integration guide.

## Build a native player

1. In **File → Build Profiles**, choose a Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS native profile.
2. Confirm in the Plugin Inspector that `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.dll` supports that profile
   and does not support WebGL.
3. Build the single `EngineLobby` scene.
4. Run the player where it can reach the server endpoint and confirm the UI text changes to the
   chat notification.

## Build a WebGL player

1. Select **File → Build Profiles → Web**, then choose **Switch Platform**.
2. Confirm the native `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.dll` is excluded and the
   `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.WebGL` assembly is included.
3. Build the `EngineLobby` scene into `Build/`.
4. Serve the build through an HTTP server and open it in a browser; do not use `file://`.
5. Confirm that `ChatNotify` replaces the UI text. This result covers the IL2CPP reverse callback,
   UPM import, jslib linkage, and main-thread pump together.

## Unity 6000.0.83f1 verification

The licensed Editor compiled with Windows and WebGL build targets using a locally restored
`netstandard2.1` native connector DLL. The native DLL was enabled for the Editor and Windows
and excluded from WebGL. The Windows Mono player built in batch mode and completed the server
lobby flow: `JoinRes` and `ChatNotify` both reported `actorId=00000003`, and the server recorded
the client connection.

The WebGL UPM package contains stable `.meta` files. Its assembly definition includes WebGL only;
the Editor resolves the sample component through the native DLL even with the WebGL build target.
The project also declares Unity's JSON serialization module. Using the local UPM source, the
WebGL player built in batch mode and completed the lobby flow in headless Chromium. `JoinRes`
reported `actorId=00000003 name=unity-player`; `ChatNotify` reported
`actorId=00000003 name=unity-player text=hello from Unity`. The server recorded the connection.
These checks used local connector artifacts; the manifest's pinned Git version and the published
NuGet package have not been verified with these changes.
