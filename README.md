# ZLink Engine Lobby Unity sample

One `ZLinkClient` MonoBehaviour connects to the Engine Lobby server with the same game code in
native and WebGL players. It sends `JoinReq` and `ChatMsg` at startup, pumps the connector from `Update`,
and replaces the centered UI text when `ChatNotify` arrives.

## Unity version

The project is pinned to **Unity 6 LTS 6000.0.83f1**. The WebGL UPM manifest allows Unity 2021.3
or later, but the repository's real WebGL adapter verification project also uses 6000.0.83f1, so
the sample and its verification target one editor version.

## Install packages

`Packages/manifest.json` pins these packages:

- NuGetForUnity `v4.5.0`
- `com.zlink.stream-connector.webgl` at `framework-node/v0.23.0`
- Unity UI `2.0.0`

`Assets/packages.config` declares `Zlink.Stream.Connector` `0.23.0` for the Editor and native
desktop/mobile/console players. If the first open reports compile errors before that package is
present, choose **Ignore**, not Safe Mode, and run **NuGet → Restore Packages**.

Both connector assemblies define the same public types, so each build target must include exactly
one:

1. Select the restored `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.dll` in the Project window.
2. In the Plugin Inspector, disable **WebGL** compatibility and enable only the Editor and required
   native platforms.
3. If the native connector is consumed as source instead of a DLL, put
   `"excludePlatforms": ["WebGL"]` in its asmdef.
4. Do not change the WebGL UPM package asmdef; it already has
   `"includePlatforms": ["WebGL"]`.

## Run the scene

1. Build and start the server from `../Server`.

   ```bash
   ./run_sample.sh build
   ./run_sample.sh run
   cat .run/stream.port
   ```

2. Open `Assets/Scenes/EngineLobby.unity` in Unity.
3. Set the `ZLinkClient` GameObject's **Endpoint** to `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` using the printed
   port.
4. Enter Play mode. The text changes from `joined as ...` to
   `unity-player: hello from Unity`.
5. After leaving Play mode, run `./run_sample.sh stop` in the server directory.

The `connect`, `pump`, `handler`, and `lifecycle` snippet markers in `ZLinkClient.cs` are the source
boundaries read by the engine integration guide.

## Build a native player

1. In **File → Build Profiles**, choose a Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS native profile.
2. Confirm in the Plugin Inspector that `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.dll` supports that profile
   and does not support WebGL.
3. Build the single `EngineLobby` scene.
4. Run the player where it can reach the server endpoint and confirm the UI text changes to the
   chat notification.

## Build a WebGL player

1. Select **File → Build Profiles → Web**, then choose **Switch Platform**.
2. Confirm the native `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.dll` is excluded and the
   `Systems.Zlink.Stream.Connector.WebGL` assembly is included.
3. Build the `EngineLobby` scene into `Build/`.
4. Serve the build through an HTTP server and open it in a browser; do not use `file://`.
5. Confirm that `ChatNotify` replaces the UI text. This result covers the IL2CPP reverse callback,
   UPM import, jslib linkage, and main-thread pump together.

## Not verified on this machine

This workspace has no Unity Editor or license. Only project sources, package pins, the scene
reference, snippet markers, and the documented native/WebGL platform split were checked here.
Editor compilation, a native player build, and the WebGL IL2CPP build require a licensed Unity
runner.
